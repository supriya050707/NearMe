                The Pullalur War Memorial, located near Kanchipuram in Tamil Nadu, commemorates two significant battles fought in the area. The first, in 618–619 CE, was between the 			
                Pallava king Mahendravarman I and the Chalukya king Pulakeshin II, with historical accounts offering differing views on the outcome. The second and more well-known battle 		
                occurred in 1780 during the Second Anglo-Mysore War, when Tipu Sultan and his father Hyder Ali decisively defeated British forces led by Colonel William Baillie. This was a 		
                major blow to the British East India Company. In memory of British officers who died in the conflict—particularly Lieutenant Colonel George Brown and Captain James Hislop—		two obelisks were erected at the site. These monuments still stand today in the midst of paddy fields near Pullalur village.
