                The Pullalur Amman Temple is a modest yet culturally significant shrine located in the village of Pullalur in Kanchipuram district, Tamil Nadu. While detailed historical               		
                records about this specific temple are limited, it is one of several temples in the area that reflect the region's rich religious heritage. Pullalur is also known for other 		
                temples such as the Sri Varadharaja Perumal Temple and the Kailasanathar Temple, which date back to the Pallava period and feature inscriptions and architectural elements 		
                from that era.
